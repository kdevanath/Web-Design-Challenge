# Web-Design-Challenge
Design a visualization web design. Created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment. Specifically, plotting weather data.

In building this dashboard, created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations.There is a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

A landing page (index.html) page containing:

An explanation of the project.
Links to each visualizations page. Contains preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.

Four visualization pages, each with:

 The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
 A short explanation of the plot and its significance.
 
 A "Comparisons" page :

Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

The grid has two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.

A "Data" page that:
Display a table containing the data used in the visualizations.
The table is bootstrap responsive table component. 

The data (Resources/Citiies.csv) was exported from csv to html using pandas.
