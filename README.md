# Web-Design-Challenge
Design a visualization web design

 <p>The purpose of this project was to compare how weather changes as you get closer to the equator. 
                            To accomplish this we pulled data from OpenWeather api for about 500 cities.</p>
                            <br />
                            After assembling the dataset, used matplotlib to plot various aspects of weather vs. latitude</p>   
                            Factors included Cloudiness, temperature, humidity, wind speed and humidity.</p>
